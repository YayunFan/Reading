## Chapter 1. HPM, SBR, meet EDR
### 1.Nuance
#### 1.1.simile vs metaphor vs analogy
https://www.masterclass.com/articles/metaphor-similie-and-analogy-differences-and-similarities#what-is-a-metaphor  
* A simile is saying something is like something else. A simile creates a comparison using like and as. 明喻  
Life is like a box of chocolates. (Forrest Gump)  
* A metaphor is often poetically saying something is something else. A metaphor is a figure of speech that directly compares one thing to another for rhetorical effect. 隐喻  
All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. (William Shakespeare's As You Like It)  
* An analogy is saying something is like something else to make some sort of an explanatory point. (show + explain)  
We can use metaphors and similes when creating an analogy.
"Letterman was like Teflon - he was so smooth and slick, he could always go with the flow, nothing ever seemed to faze him, and he was never without a witty quip or two." (simile)

### 2.Nine frameworks
**People like to be the center of attention. The more attention you give them, the more they're likely to talk. Thus, EDR > SBR > HPM**  

#### 2.1.HPM (History, Philosophy, Metaphor - more focus on you)
* **History: your personal experience**  
That reminds me of the last time I skied…  
That's just like the first time I skied as a child…  
What a coincidence, my mother's friend went skiing last week and had a blast…  
(To have a very fun or exciting time (doing something). A: "So, how was the ski trip?" B: "We had a blast!")  
* **Philosophy: personal stance, take, or opinion on a specific topic**
I've always loved skiing because…   
I've hated skiing ever since…  
Skiing is so fun! My favorite hobby.  
I don't know how I feel about skiing. On one hand…  
* **Metaphor: involves what the conversion topic reminds you of (transition for subtly changing topic)**

That's just the opposite of snowboarding, isn't it?  
That makes me think of…  
Isn't that similar to…  
  

#### 2.2.SBR (Specific, Broad, Related)
* **Specific: ask targeted questions regarding to the topic you're talking about**  
What kind of slopes did you go down?  
How was the snow?  
How many times have you skied recently?  
How long … -> It's not a good question, since the answer is short and hard to elaborate.  
* **Broad: ask broad questions about the topic (main topic to a subtopic, new topic)**  
Where was this? Who did you go with? When was this? How did you drive there?  
* **Related: ask about something that is either directly or broadly related to the subject**  
I love when it's snowing outside. I love taking weekend trips. Isn't it great, getting physically active as much as possible?


#### 2.3.EDR (Emotion, Detail, Restatements)
* **Emotion: you state someone else's emotion or emotional state**
I went skiing last weekend! - You sound really excited about that.
If you were wrong... "Actually, I'm not. Here's why…"/ right… "Totally, it's very thrilling to be on the slopes."
* **Details: ask for deatils**
When did you start doing that?  
How did that make you feel?  
* **Restatements: restate or summarize what the other person said**  
This creates a tremendous sense of comfort and validation for the other person.  
I went skiing in the mountains last weekend. -- So you went skiing in the mountains last weekend?

#### 1. words

**park** their egos and let the other people's trains run  
It just amounts to **putting** the burning thoughts in you brain **aside** for the time being. 

## Chapter 10. Use Fallback Stories
#### 1. Words
1. Enage people, **invigorate** a conversation, or get a rise and laugh out of people that feel a bit too **stiff** at the moment.  
2. Imagine that a conversation is dying down, or there is a **lull** between topics. 
3. The story just introduces one or two main **premises** and I don’t go into the nitty-gritty detail because that’s not what drives a conversation forward.

5. If you can't, your stories are probably **rambling** messes that make people **scream internally**.  
6. The other person will feel safer after you’ve disclosed your position first – that’s just a **facet** of human psychology.

  * 1)the bridging sentence
  * 2)the story itself
  * 3)your opinion of the story
  * 4)asking for other person's opinion in a few different ways
  
* Example: 
  * Hey, you know what I heard recently?  
  * One of my female friends just proposed to her boyfriend, and now they are engaged. Apparently she just didn’t want to keep waiting and decided to be progressive and ignore gender roles and take her life into her own hands. She even had a ring and everything.
  * When I first heard about it, I generally thought why not, it's 2016! I know them both and it kind of suits their relationship.  
  * What do you think about that? Would you ever do that? How would you react if your significant other did that with you? Would you do the ring as well?  

## Chapter 11. The "Thought Experiment" Technique
**Think of the “thought experiment” like wearing an intellectual costume.** You free them from the consequences of their statements and just allow them to address the actual substantive question being asked.  
#### 1. Words
It can easily **blow up** in your face.  
It can easily **come off** as an **inquisition** instead of something fun and engage people's problem-solving and intellectual faculties.  

#### 2. Tips to construct the thought experiment
You should construct the thought experiement to make it look like an interesting moral dilemma/ problem-solving, rather than it seems as if you are looking for "right" answers.  
What makes thought experiement engaging is the other person feels as if you've given them a puzzle to unravel. You can pose interesting scenarios and ask thought provoking questions.  
Put the spotlight not on the person but on the hypothetical situation.  
The secret is to allow people to feel separate from their self-consciousness and their fear of judgement. This way they will feel they are purely in the real of intellectual concepts.  

## Chapter 12. Make the other person an expert
#### 1. Words
But the small **nuisances** of smelling like sunscreen, sand in **every nook and cranny**.  
In a sense,  
do it explicitly and **out of the blue**  

#### 2. 
* Curiousity is an approach to others that makes you more receptive to them. Taking it a step further and turning your conversation partner into your de facto teacher – that’s an approach that makes them more receptive to you in the long run.  
* Making the other person an expert or teacher means that you react and ask questions in a way that allows them to teach you and feel a sense of superiority and validation in the interaction.  
* All you need to do is follow up with questions that dig deeper and encourage them to educate you.  
* The point here is to let them inflate their confidence and by extension, become more comfortable with you.  
* Something that implies thet have greater knowledge
  * This is random, but did you know that forks used to be made from the bark of trees?  
* Samples:
  * (Not good) Oh, cool, interesting. 
  * (Good - provides a huge positive impact) Wow, you know so much! I never thought about that before.  
  * (Good) No way! Tell me more about that.
  * (Good) I'm learning so much. What about X?  
  * (Good) You definitely know a lot about X. Does Y matter in X?  
  * (No impliement, but you can do this putting favorable labels on people) Wow,you're definitely the expert and teacher on this subject. Tell me more, this is great!  

## Chapter 13. Master saying "What were you saying"
#### 1. Words
This is when you **barge into** someon't statement. / We can't just barge into a private garden.  
One person has to gracefully **bow out** and allow the other to continue. You **yield the floor**.  
Most people often have an exaggerated opinion of their conversation skills.  
Saying this statement reverses any feeling of powerlessness or **disenfranisement**.

# 随便聊聊
Chapter 1 & 2
不管是中文还是英文闲聊本质都是一样的，如何让对方有倾诉欲，和你聊得来。  
我欠缺的其实是2方面，1是get不到对方的全部信息，无法判断出哪一块他更想分享更多或者有更多故事，有想问的却不能脱口而出，当心里默默酝酿的时候就错过机会了。-- **好办，练口语听力，找人聊天**  
2是没有基本的文化背景，很难让别人感觉和你聊的来。就像和中国人聊天，吃的东西都相似可以交流，看的影视娱乐作品可以交流，关注的明星八卦可以交流，脱口而出的苟利国家生死以的文化积淀。-- **难办**  

Chapter 3 & 4  
和朋友聊天时emotion对我们来说毫无障碍。但是和外国人聊天，还是老问题，听力导致了我们的trigger words反应，应该尽量避免，使自己的反应更接近中文对话时。 -- **练口语听力 again**  
看到association时其实我想到的是2个问题，1是我有一个很不好的习惯，就是习惯assume对方要讲的或者要问的是这个，这就会导致有时候我会错了意。 -- 慢慢改正吧make my mind to **go blank and zero**.  2是association其实我们都是没有问题的，问题的核心还是因为词汇和即时造句能力，我们无法用英语在稍微专业的其他领域交流。比如和同事聊到他周末要去biking,如果我有这方面的了解的话，完全可以就biking设备，biking比赛，biking经历等展开一系列的聊天，但是我并没有，于是conversation got stuck.而这个问题不仅是英语沟通，中文沟通也存在，比如上次父母问我网线五代线六代线的问题，我就答不上来，而我及时谷歌了学习了下做解答。（当然当时最好的做法其实是association转移话题）  

Chapter 12  
teacher and student. 这一章又多次提到了kick your ego to the curb （第9章derail your train of thought多次提到），殊途同归。我影响最深的应该是“You might be thinking that you know much more than this person and they have nothing to teach you. That’s not the point.”对话真的是向下兼容的。工作中我和某些senior同事聊天会有如沐春风的感觉，显然他们向下兼容了我。
Chapter 13  
I realized that the word spotlight almost appears in each chapter. In the conversation, make the parties be in the spotlight, no matter what way, they will feel more comfortable.
