## Chapter 1. HPM, SBR, meet EDR
### 1.Nuance
#### 1.1.simile vs metaphor vs analogy
https://www.masterclass.com/articles/metaphor-similie-and-analogy-differences-and-similarities#what-is-a-metaphor  
* A simile is saying something is like something else. A simile creates a comparison using like and as. 明喻  
Life is like a box of chocolates. (Forrest Gump)  
* A metaphor is often poetically saying something is something else. A metaphor is a figure of speech that directly compares one thing to another for rhetorical effect. 隐喻  
All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. (William Shakespeare's As You Like It)  
* An analogy is saying something is like something else to make some sort of an explanatory point. (show + explain)  
We can use metaphors and similes when creating an analogy.
"Letterman was like Teflon - he was so smooth and slick, he could always go with the flow, nothing ever seemed to faze him, and he was never without a witty quip or two." (simile)

### 2.Nine frameworks
**People like to be the center of attention. The more attention you give them, the more they're likely to talk. Thus, EDR > SBR > HPM**  

#### 2.1.HPM (History, Philosophy, Metaphor - more focus on you)
* **History: your personal experience**  
That reminds me of the last time I skied…  
That's just like the first time I skied as a child…  
What a coincidence, my mother's friend went skiing last week and had a blast…  
(To have a very fun or exciting time (doing something). A: "So, how was the ski trip?" B: "We had a blast!")  
* **Philosophy: personal stance, take, or opinion on a specific topic**
I've always loved skiing because…   
I've hated skiing ever since…  
Skiing is so fun! My favorite hobby.  
I don't know how I feel about skiing. On one hand…  
* **Metaphor: involves what the conversion topic reminds you of (transition for subtly changing topic)**  
That reminds me of…  
That's just the opposite of snowboarding, isn't it?  
That makes me think of…  
Isn't that similar to…  
  

#### 2.2.SBR (Specific, Broad, Related)
* **Specific: ask targeted questions regarding to the topic you're talking about**  
What kind of slopes did you go down?  
How was the snow?  
How many times have you skied recently?  
How long … -> It's not a good question, since the answer is short and hard to elaborate.  
* **Broad: ask broad questions about the topic (main topic to a subtopic, new topic)**  
Where was this? Who did you go with? When was this? How did you drive there?  
* **Related: ask about something that is either directly or broadly related to the subject**  
I love when it's snowing outside. I love taking weekend trips. Isn't it great, getting physically active as much as possible?


#### 2.3.EDR (Emotion, Detail, Restatements)
* **Emotion: you state someone else's emotion or emotional state**
I went skiing last weekend! - You sound really excited about that.
If you were wrong... "Actually, I'm not. Here's why…"/ right… "Totally, it's very thrilling to be on the slopes."
* **Details: ask for deatils**
When did you start doing that?  
How did that make you feel?  
* **Restatements: restate or summarize what the other person said**  
This creates a tremendous sense of comfort and validation for the other person.  
I went skiing in the mountains last weekend. -- So you went skiing in the mountains last weekend?  


## Chapter 2. Never Speak in absolutes
#### 1.Interesting Verbs
You question will **fail**, the conversation will **stall**, and you may never **get back on track**.  
Make conversation difficult for people and **lead** to premature death.  
That's how conversation takes off.

#### 2.Horrible absolute questions (Try to ask yourself, if you think there is no wiggle room, that is bad question. Good question should be easy to answer)
What's your number one favorite movie of all time?
What's your favotie band? 

#### 3.Magic Transform (terrible, hard, tiring -> fun, easy, pleasant, comfortable) Put boundaries around the question and make it non-absolute
What's your favorite movie? -> What are your top few movies? / What are some good movies you've seen recently? / Any comedy movies you consider pretty decent and can recommend?  


# 随便聊聊
不管是中文还是英文闲聊本质都是一样的，如何让对方有倾诉欲，和你聊得来。  
我欠缺的其实是2方面，1是get不到对方的全部信息，无法判断出哪一块他更想分享更多或者有更多故事，有想问的却不能脱口而出，当心里默默酝酿的时候就错过机会了。-- **好办，练口语听力，找人聊天**
2是没有基本的文化背景，很难让别人感觉和你聊的来。就像和中国人聊天，吃的东西都相似可以交流，看的影视娱乐作品可以交流，关注的明星八卦可以交流，脱口而出的苟利国家生死以的文化积淀。-- **难办**
